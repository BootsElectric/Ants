Implement elm-2d-game and WebGL

Refactor the Lists of tiles to use a Dict

Think about the none game aspect of the project such as which aspects of Elm lend themselves to game development as well as talking about the libraries: how are these aspects related to game design and why should elm be used over another language (or not)

What are the features of Elm?
 - strongly, statically typed language
 - Functional (no side effects)
 - The compiler does not allow for run time errors to occur when using elm-make -Almost all errors are caught by the type system 
 - libraries
